    <p > I am currently a junior at Texas A&M University. Planned graduation is Spring 2021 with a bachelor's degree in computer engineering in the electrical track. I plan on focusing in software engineering after graduation as that is where my passion is. I like both hardware and software but after attending the Google Computer Science Summer Institute, I got attached to the programming side a bit more. While at the CSSI program I delve head on into programming and website development. In a team of three, I help build a concept site that helps people connect with mentors in the computer science field. Since then I’ve learn other languages such as Java, C++, Python, and currently Flutter/Dart. I am also in the process of building an app for my organization to connect members together, easily track points, and display member activities. </p>
    <p> Being a computer engineer has also given me the opportunity to learn how higher level programming language function, and has only built my ability to design, test, develop, and debug programs. I want to continue growing my skill set and contribute in the field of quantum programming. Although we are still in the early stages of quantum computing, it is developing quite fast. Microsoft already has a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/quantum/development-kit">  programming language called Q#</a>. I would like to help in the transition of traditional binary programming into quantum programming. It is going to take many years for this to happen, but we can create a foundation for it. </p>
    <p>There are many things to lose yourself in within the computer science field so it is a good idea to have a focus in mind. With the ever changing field of computer science, you never know what the next big thing will be or what language will become obsolete. That’s why I’ll continue developing my knowledge across a variety of languages and skills.</p>
